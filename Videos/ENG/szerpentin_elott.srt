1
00:00:01,455 --> 00:00:06,001
I’m going to set a storm god against the forces of mad science.

2
00:00:06,156 --> 00:00:08,848
Well, that’s Borgovia for you in a nutshell.

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:16,141
While the Resistance is safely holed up in the Lair, I’m leaving the city to find this Perun.

4
00:00:16,791 --> 00:00:24,200
Prisoner Seven is taking us to an abandoned part of the mountains, 
far beyond the reaches I’ve already explored.

5
00:00:24,622 --> 00:00:28,126
Our destination seems to be shrouded in mystery.

6
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:32,115
The place has a nasty reputation. That’s all I know.

7
00:00:32,215 --> 00:00:38,427
Even the Professor avoided those peaks for some reason 
and removed it from the official maps.

8
00:00:38,905 --> 00:00:45,230
Prisoner Seven is oddly silent about this forbidden plateau, 
which makes me even more curious.

9
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:49,620
It’s time to do some exploration.
