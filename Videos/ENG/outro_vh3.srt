1
00:00:04,819 --> 00:00:09,199
I came to Borgovia to free this land from evil

2
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11,916
and I kept my promise.

3
00:00:12,565 --> 00:00:14,735
I defeated a mad scientist

4
00:00:15,138 --> 00:00:20,065
fought a military genius and put a stop to Koschei’s grand plan.

5
00:00:20,311 --> 00:00:24,723
Still, these villains caused too much destruction and pain.

6
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,453
I saved Borgovia

7
00:00:28,462 --> 00:00:31,138
but it has become a ruined city

8
00:00:31,173 --> 00:00:33,173
where the Ink is spilling free

9
00:00:33,442 --> 00:00:38,849
twisting reality and opening gates to the otherworld.

10
00:00:39,919 --> 00:00:44,312
However, it’s also a new beginning.

11
00:00:44,736 --> 00:00:48,574
We can rebuild Borgova into a new metropolis

12
00:00:48,877 --> 00:00:51,948
where mythical creatures and ordinary people

13
00:00:52,176 --> 00:00:56,641
can live among the marvels of weird science.

14
00:00:56,942 --> 00:00:58,951
One thing is for sure:

15
00:00:59,277 --> 00:01:01,125
my adventure ends here

16
00:01:02,058 --> 00:01:03,970
and whatever follows

17
00:01:04,742 --> 00:01:08,772
it will be another story.
