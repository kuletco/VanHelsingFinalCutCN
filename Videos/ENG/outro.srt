1
00:00:03,523 --> 00:00:09,308
I did everything within my power to liberate
 this land from the clutches of madness.

2
00:00:09,884 --> 00:00:12,688
I destroyed a whole army of machines

3
00:00:13,428 --> 00:00:16,048
and defeated incredible monsters…

4
00:00:16,608 --> 00:00:21,394
only to suffer the betrayal of my closest ally.

5
00:00:22,796 --> 00:00:26,575
The road to hell is paved with good intentions, they say.

6
00:00:27,759 --> 00:00:34,489
Unwillingly I let Prisoner Seven obtain the most terrifying force in Borgovia.

7
00:00:34,874 --> 00:00:39,018
But whatever inhuman creature is hiding behind the mask

8
00:00:39,767 --> 00:00:42,230
he made a grave mistake.

9
00:00:43,034 --> 00:00:44,678
I am still alive.

10
00:00:45,387 --> 00:00:49,102
And I’m ready to hunt again.
