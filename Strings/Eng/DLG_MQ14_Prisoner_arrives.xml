				<Desc>
					<eng>Foolishness! You will need the full wrath of Perun against the Force Domes! You can't let these gibbering wardens distract from your goal!</eng>
				</Desc>

			<node2>
				<Desc>
					<eng>You have destroyed those charms  and anyone can enter now. Even creatures like… this. Don't listen to him. He feels wrong. Listen to me. We could really tap the power of Perun for you. And that's our last offer.</eng>

				<Desc>
					<eng>Was this a thinly disguised threat, little warden? That's very… ill-advised.</eng>

				<Desc>
					<eng>Indeed it is. You want a fight? You'll get it.</eng>
				</Desc>

				<Desc>
					<eng>Calm down, friend. They know Perun more than anyone. If they tell me that they can tap his power, I believe them. Do it, Guardian!</eng>
				</Desc>

				<Desc>
					<eng>I never thought I'd say it, but I'm glad that you found a compromise. I'm not in the mood for killing sacred guardians. I know, I'm sentimental.</eng>

					<eng>Hey! You are not supposed to be here? Protection charms, forbidden plateau, remember?</eng>
