1
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:06,834
My name is Van Helsing,
and I’m a monster hunter.

2
00:00:07,294 --> 00:00:14,077
You could call it a twist of fate that I came to Borgovia
to help the monsters who once ruled this land…

3
00:00:14,077 --> 00:00:17,043
…although it took a while to reach my destination.

4
00:00:17,381 --> 00:00:21,266
At least the detour gave me an opportunity to explore the wilderness.

5
00:00:21,977 --> 00:00:27,261
At times I was really grateful that I had my companion, Lady Katarina at my side.

6
00:00:27,606 --> 00:00:34,298
I wouldn’t want her to hear that, though. For a ghost she can be remarkably vain…
and murderous.

7
00:00:35,296 --> 00:00:41,232
Borgovia is a fascinating land… at least from a hunter’s perspective.

8
00:00:41,318 --> 00:00:45,609
Also this is the only place where
the Ink, the dark material

9
00:00:45,609 --> 00:00:49,122
of creation, leaks through
the cracks of the world.

10
00:00:49,552 --> 00:00:54,868
A long time ago my father defeated
Borgovia’s immortal vampire lords

11
00:00:55,068 --> 00:00:58,837
and entrusted the land to
a group of genius scientists.

12
00:00:59,657 --> 00:01:05,304
During our travels we slowly began to suspect that it must have been a mistake.

13
00:01:05,851 --> 00:01:09,697
When we entered the dark city of
Borgova, it became evident that

14
00:01:09,697 --> 00:01:14,160
the new age of enlightenment had
only brought chaos and mayhem.

15
00:01:15,009 --> 00:01:19,145
I did what I had to do. I found my
father’s underground lair

16
00:01:19,345 --> 00:01:26,798
and gathered the members of the Resistance,
the rebellious mortals and immortals fighting together.

17
00:01:26,898 --> 00:01:28,410
And how we fought!

18
00:01:28,802 --> 00:01:30,185
It was glorious.

19
00:01:30,736 --> 00:01:36,484
We battled impossible creatures.
We repelled tides of inhuman invaders.

20
00:01:37,262 --> 00:01:43,027
And I wouldn’t rest until I had defeated the last mad scientist, Professor Fulmigati.

21
00:01:43,127 --> 00:01:46,026
He even had a proper Doomsday Automaton.

22
00:01:46,597 --> 00:01:51,887
Honestly? It was a hunter’s dream come true.

23
00:01:52,184 --> 00:02:01,654
But as it turns out, winning the grand battle
sometimes opens up a brand new adventure.
