					<eng>Van Helsing! I’ll require your special expertise for a short while, if you don’t mind.</eng>

				<Desc>
					<eng>As usual, I realized that the only person who could do it… is me.</eng>

				<Desc>
					<eng>I’m glad to help. If it doesn’t involve any experiments.</eng>

				<Desc>
					<eng>It does, actually. This was the last experiment by Professor Von Sturm. He infused some machines with the essence of the Ink that gave them some kind of a raw intelligence. One of the machines is an automated turret, by the way.</eng>

					<eng>And now they are lonely and need a cuddle?</eng>
				</Desc>
			</node4>
			<node5>
				<Desc>
					<eng>That was sarcasm, right? The answer is no. The machines are intelligent and aggressive. And they can Inkwalk. We finally located their hideout, now we only need someone to destroy the Machine King!</eng>

				<Desc>
					<eng>It sounds better than cuddling. I’ll do it.</eng>

					<eng>If I see someone cut out for the task, I’ll tell you.</eng>

				<Desc>
					<eng>You are back! Did you find someone who could destroy the Machine King?</eng>
				</Desc>

				<Desc>
					<eng>I’m still looking. Be patient.</eng>
