1
00:00:02,829 --> 00:00:07,746
I came to Borgovia to free the land from the tyranny of mad science,

2
00:00:08,436 --> 00:00:13,556
but the fall of Fulmigati was the spark that ignited the flames of the civil war.

3
00:00:14,095 --> 00:00:18,810
So I led the Resistance against the military genius who tried to destroy us.

4
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:24,341
I faced an army of mechanical monsters and defeated General Harker

5
00:00:24,833 --> 00:00:29,666
 only to suffer betrayal from my mysterious ally, Prisoner Seven,

6
00:00:29,967 --> 00:00:33,879
who tricked me and obtained the most powerful artifact in the land,

7
00:00:34,364 --> 00:00:37,599
the hidden death of Koschei the Deathless.

8
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:41,332
Prisoner Seven disappeared into the depths of the otherworld,

9
00:00:41,828 --> 00:00:43,942
but I will track him down.

10
00:00:44,049 --> 00:00:45,985
It’s not only about revenge.

11
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:48,044
I’m a hunter,

12
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:50,080
he is my nemesis

13
00:00:50,461 --> 00:00:52,757
and he has a plan.

14
00:00:52,912 --> 00:00:55,597
The citizens are looking to me for guidance,

15
00:00:56,134 --> 00:00:59,304
but I must find Prisoner Seven first.

16
00:01:00,005 --> 00:01:01,748
It's a tough decision.

17
00:01:02,092 --> 00:01:04,405
Chaos reigns in Borgova.

18
00:01:04,749 --> 00:01:08,306
Warbands, gangs and bickering political factions

19
00:01:08,307 --> 00:01:11,180
want to take power into their own hands.

20
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:12,580
What's more

21
00:01:12,657 --> 00:01:16,734
the city is plagued by the sudden appearance of the Cult of Seven.

22
00:01:17,251 --> 00:01:21,444
Led by a mechanical monster, the beastly Infiltrator,

23
00:01:21,945 --> 00:01:27,317
they break into Fulmigati’s former laboratories  and seize precious equipment.

24
00:01:28,209 --> 00:01:31,055
Evidently my nemesis is behind all this,

25
00:01:31,367 --> 00:01:34,909
and it can only be the beginning of something worse.

26
00:01:36,019 --> 00:01:41,290
This time I know which facility the Infiltrator will attack next.

27
00:01:41,807 --> 00:01:46,916
A secret laboratory and a horde of monsters…

28
00:01:46,924 --> 00:01:50,025
Just like old times.
