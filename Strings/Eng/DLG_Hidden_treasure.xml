				<Desc>
					<eng>All I can see is a boring old chest.</eng>
				</Desc>
			</node2>
			<node3>
				<Desc>
					<eng>Because this is a traditional chest, hiding in plain sight. Not a modern one with all those high security standards. You know, reinforced lids, poisoned darts and the like.</eng>

					<eng>Then what are you waiting for? …What have we here?</eng>
				</Desc>

			<node5>
				<Desc>
					<eng>Let me see. A rare artifact… something that looks like one of those gems from Borislav’s statue… and a dragon tooth! A real one. And gold, of course. Plenty of that.</eng>
