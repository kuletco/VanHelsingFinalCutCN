1
00:00:02,313 --> 00:00:04,302
It all began with a call for help.

2
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,600
A letter from Borgovia, addressed to Van Helsing,

3
00:00:08,267 --> 00:00:09,877
the great monster-slayer.

4
00:00:10,301 --> 00:00:11,222
My father.

5
00:00:11,446 --> 00:00:15,180
He doesn’t take cases any more, but I am a hunter too.

6
00:00:15,583 --> 00:00:20,752
So I set off on the journey with Lady Katarina,  
my remarkable companion.

7
00:00:22,052 --> 00:00:26,323
I’m an expert on the supernatural and I seem to be drawn to it.

8
00:00:26,796 --> 00:00:32,019
Occasionally events get out of control and then we have to leave in quite a hurry.

9
00:00:32,722 --> 00:00:34,666
Sometimes it’s Katarina’s fault.

10
00:00:35,343 --> 00:00:37,401
She can be quite reckless at times.

11
00:00:37,905 --> 00:00:41,403
Still, she always helps me save the day.

12
00:00:41,702 --> 00:00:45,404
And… she also happens to be a ghost.

13
00:00:45,645 --> 00:00:48,134
My father rescued her from Borgovia

14
00:00:48,234 --> 00:00:51,403
and she has been bound to serve our family ever since.

15
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:53,818
Katarina often complains about it,

16
00:00:54,082 --> 00:00:57,227
 but I think she really likes the thrill of the adventure.

17
00:00:57,797 --> 00:01:01,952
She is a charming soul, but she also has a darker side.

18
00:01:02,311 --> 00:01:03,193
Good.

19
00:01:03,358 --> 00:01:06,250
It comes in helpful when I’m in danger.

20
00:01:06,712 --> 00:01:10,151
Somewhere along the way we slowly learned to work together.

21
00:01:10,232 --> 00:01:14,091
And finally, in the cold rain of Venice, we became a team.

22
00:01:14,755 --> 00:01:16,955
The last leg of the journey was by sea.

23
00:01:17,443 --> 00:01:22,621
Apart from the Kraken, the pirates and the storms it was mostly uneventful.

24
00:01:23,324 --> 00:01:25,609
I had time to ponder my mission.

25
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,191
Once Borgovia was a dark place where monsters lived.

26
00:01:29,669 --> 00:01:32,635
long ago my father defeated the immortal kings,

27
00:01:32,923 --> 00:01:38,028
created a peace treaty and entrusted the land to some enlightened individuals.

28
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,346
What could have happened there?

29
00:01:39,698 --> 00:01:43,029
What could be even more frightening than the reign of monsters?

30
00:01:43,066 --> 00:01:47,076
The closer we drew to Borgovia, the more confusing the rumors became.

31
00:01:47,528 --> 00:01:51,322
The land behind the Thunderhead Mountains was wrapped in mystery.

32
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,696
As our carriage approached the mountain pass, I had a sense of foreboding.

33
00:01:55,893 --> 00:01:58,920
It didn’t really surprise me when I heard an explosion.

34
00:01:59,501 --> 00:02:04,139
The adventure has just begun.
