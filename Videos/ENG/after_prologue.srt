1
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:09,417
It all seemed so simple: 
defeat the mad scientist and ride into the sunset.

2
00:00:10,331 --> 00:00:13,754
But sometimes victory leaves you buried under the ruins.

3
00:00:14,205 --> 00:00:20,910
I was lucky: someone saved me. 
For a change I’m not the only mysterious stranger in town.

4
00:00:21,193 --> 00:00:27,593
But weeks have passed,  and the metropolis of weird science 
is still waiting for its own savior.

5
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:31,727
Outlaws and escaped monsters roam the streets.

6
00:00:31,884 --> 00:00:38,097
The Resistance is too weak, so someone else decided 
to take matters into his own hands.

7
00:00:38,525 --> 00:00:43,661
General Harker, the military genius of the city, came back from his exile.

8
00:00:44,439 --> 00:00:52,270
He gathered the rest of the disorganized army. His forces are 
a chaotic mess of weird machines... so far.

9
00:00:52,592 --> 00:00:55,592
But they are slowly clearing out the streets.

10
00:00:56,041 --> 00:00:58,872
He might not have seen eye to eye with Fulmigati,

11
00:00:58,994 --> 00:01:03,051
but he regards me and the Resistance as a threat to the city.

12
00:01:03,217 --> 00:01:06,295
A coalition of monsters and troublemakers.

13
00:01:06,809 --> 00:01:11,260
As a hunter I won’t tolerate others hunting me.

14
00:01:11,635 --> 00:01:19,436
I’m ready to fight. I have an underground Lair, new soldiers… 
and my new, mysterious ally.

15
00:01:19,677 --> 00:01:25,871
I’m quite used to unlikely companions, but Prisoner Seven is the most unusual so far.

16
00:01:26,054 --> 00:01:31,592
A former test subject of the mad scientists, master of the Ink…

17
00:01:32,023 --> 00:01:36,772
he’s certainly helpful, but I don’t know what to make of him.

18
00:01:37,249 --> 00:01:39,730
Now he can prove his worth.

19
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:47,757
Harker’s troops are on the move. They want to control the foundries 
so he can build more warmachines.

20
00:01:48,971 --> 00:01:53,901
We will stop them in the sizzling, clanking heart of Borgova.

21
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:57,890
Let the battle begin!
