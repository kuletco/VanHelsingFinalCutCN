				<Desc>
					<eng>Oh, that's great! Travelers! I was afraid I was going to have to spend the next century in this cave.</eng>
				</Desc>
			</node1>
			<node10>
				<Desc>
					<eng>But you can ask others to help you out? It feels like cheating.</eng>
				</Desc>

			<node11>
				<Desc>
					<eng>That's all? A clock? That shouldn't be a problem, kobolds or not.</eng>
				</Desc>
			</node11>
			<node12>
				<Desc>
					<eng>Oh, joy! I suppose it comes at a price, though.</eng>
				</Desc>
			</node12>
			<node13>
				<Desc>
					<eng>No. If it belonged to your elders, I won't ask anything from you. But our Resistance could use the help of a skilled engineer.</eng>
				</Desc>
			</node13>
			<node14>
				<Desc>
					<eng>Actually, I was considering enlisting anyway. It's a disgrace what the people in charge committed in the name of Science down there. But I need that clockwork - then I'd be glad to help.</eng>
				</Desc>

			<node2>
				<Desc>
					<eng>Why can’t you leave? Are you a demon bound to this place? Not that I mind, you know, I'm just being careful.</eng>
				</Desc>
			</node2>
			<node3>
				<Desc>
					<eng>Heavens, no! I'm a humble engineer. I lost my mechanical aides, and I don’t dare to enter the inner caverns. It's swarming with kobolds.</eng>
				</Desc>
			</node3>
			<node4>
				<Desc>
					<eng>And what prevents you from leaving the cave? A curse?</eng>
				</Desc>
			</node4>
			<node5>
				<Desc>
					<eng>What's with you people? No! I've sworn an oath to retrieve a relic of my elders. It's an ancient clock, the first experiment in science and magic. It's somewhere here, and I can't leave without it.</eng>
				</Desc>

			<node6>
				<Desc>
					<eng>This is your lucky day. We have your clockwork.</eng>
