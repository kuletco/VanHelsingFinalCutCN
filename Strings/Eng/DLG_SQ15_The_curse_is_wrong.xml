					<eng>Hold it right there, stranger.  You can't pass. This is sacred land.</eng>
				</Desc>

			<node10>
				<Desc>
					<eng>You can have your relic.</eng>
				</Desc>

			<node11>
				<Desc>
					<eng>Did you find our ancient relic, hunter?</eng>
				</Desc>
			</node11>
			<node12>
				<Desc>
					<eng>Not yet. These things take time.</eng>
				</Desc>
			</node12>
			<node13>
				<Desc>
					<eng>We can't break the curse on that forsaken village.</eng>
				</Desc>
			</node13>
			<node14>
				<Desc>
					<eng>Yes, I found your ancient relic.</eng>
				</Desc>
			</node14>
			<node2>
				<Desc>
					<eng>Actually, I have quite a lot to do here. I came to deal with the curse that the Spiritwalkers brought down upon a village. I want you to break the curse.</eng>
				</Desc>
			</node2>
			<node3>
				<Desc>
					<eng>I know that village well. A hive of murders and brigands who stole from our ancestors.  The curse stays until we get our stolen relic back.</eng>
				</Desc>
			</node3>
			<node4>
				<Desc>
					<eng>Don't worry. I'll hunt down your relic for you.</eng>
				</Desc>
			</node4>
			<node5>
				<Desc>
					<eng>You know, I don't like your attitude. I'll break that curse on my own thenâ€¦ when I tear down your totem.</eng>
				</Desc>
			</node5>
			<node6>
				<Desc>
					<eng>Then it's a good thing that I found your relic among the possessions of a monster.</eng>
				</Desc>
			</node6>
			<node7>
				<Desc>
					<eng>Give it to me then, hunter, and we can lift the curse from that forsaken village.</eng>
				</Desc>
			</node7>
			<node8>
				<Desc>
					<eng>This relic is far too valuable and I want to keep hold of it.</eng>
				</Desc>
			</node8>
			<node9>
				<Desc>
					<eng>How dare you? We will take it from you by force.</eng>
