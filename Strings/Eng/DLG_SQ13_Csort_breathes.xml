					<eng>Good to see you, stranger! You must be a hunter, I presume.</eng>
				</Desc>
			</node1>
			<node10>
				<Desc>
					<eng>That's pure gibberish. What was that supposed to mean?</eng>
				</Desc>
			</node10>
			<node11>
				<Desc>
					<eng>Honestly? I have no idea, but it always worked for me.</eng>
				</Desc>
			</node11>
			<node12>
				<Desc>
					<eng>I don't see how this concerns us.</eng>
				</Desc>
			</node12>
			<node13>
				<Desc>
					<eng>Well, I hired a hunter recently who looked like you a bit.</eng>
				</Desc>
			</node13>
			<node2>
				<Desc>
					<eng>And how can you possibly know that? Is it the weapons? The air of mystery? The ghost?</eng>
				</Desc>

			<node3>
				<Desc>
					<eng>That hunter was supposed to destroy a black idol in the Ink, but he hasn't returned yet. The idol ties this spot to the Ink and allows monsters to pass through freely. I can keep them back, but not for long.</eng>
				</Desc>
			</node3>
			<node4>
				<Desc>
					<eng>If this hunter is truly anything like me, he has already destroyed the idol and he's killing monsters on the other side.</eng>
				</Desc>
			</node4>
			<node5>
				<Desc>
					<eng>I doubt that.  The bridge would be closed in that case, but it's still here. The question is: are you willing to help me?</eng>
				</Desc>
			</node5>
			<node6>
				<Desc>
					<eng>Yes. I'd like to meet this hunter anyway.</eng>
				</Desc>
			</node6>
			<node7>
				<Desc>
					<eng>Give the man some more time. We have other things to do.  Goodbye.</eng>
				</Desc>
			</node7>
			<node8>
				<Desc>
					<eng>Wait! If the gate bridge disappears after the idol is shattered, how will we return?</eng>
				</Desc>
			</node8>
			<node9>
				<Desc>
					<eng>The following incantation will open a temporary gate at the idol: "FlooMe!"</eng>
				</Desc>
