			<node11>
				<Desc>
					<eng>We want to smuggle some flesh back to the Titan, to make her stronger, so we could try to break out of this prison before the next harvest. If she makes it, we make it too.</eng>
				</Desc>

			<node12>
				<Desc>
					<eng>I want to get to the root of this macabre tale. What's next?</eng>

				<Desc>
					<eng>With the huge chunks of meat pinned to them?</eng>
				</Desc>
			</node6>
			<node7>
				<Desc>
					<eng>The Tormentors harvest the flesh of the Titan every few centuries to keep him weak. And it's displayed here to make us suffer. We can't die, but remain starving, as the meat is protected by a curse.</eng>
