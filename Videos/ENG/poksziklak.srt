1
00:00:01,505 --> 00:00:04,183
So this is what Prisoner Seven told me.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,430
Ages ago Koschei, the magician concealed his death to become immortal…

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:15,197
but that was also his downfall 
when his enemies got hold of his precious treasure.

4
00:00:15,745 --> 00:00:17,643
The Deathless One is no more,

5
00:00:17,643 --> 00:00:21,328
but the essence of his death couldn’t be destroyed.

6
00:00:21,485 --> 00:00:23,283
It is such a terrible power

7
00:00:23,483 --> 00:00:26,710
that even the mad scientists thought it better to quarantine

8
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:29,068
the whole mountain where it was buried.

9
00:00:29,374 --> 00:00:32,585
Harker is ready to use this abomination against us.

10
00:00:32,585 --> 00:00:37,591
He couldn’t destroy me, so he is willing to destroy everything.
