1
00:00:02,897 --> 00:00:07,870
A good hunter will not hesitate to follow his prey beyond the edge of this world.

2
00:00:08,445 --> 00:00:10,043
The Ink is the otherworld

3
00:00:10,044 --> 00:00:12,064
the swirling haze of mist

4
00:00:12,534 --> 00:00:16,656
where chunks of reality are tangled within the fabric of dreams.

5
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:21,304
A timeless realm of fabled kingdoms and fallen gods.

6
00:00:21,542 --> 00:00:23,430
Like a spider in his nest

7
00:00:23,972 --> 00:00:26,947
my nemesis is waiting for me here.

8
00:00:27,525 --> 00:00:29,698
I hope he’s expecting me.

9
00:00:29,805 --> 00:00:32,973
I’ve already destroyed his source of power.

10
00:00:33,734 --> 00:00:36,939
Now I must destroy him.
