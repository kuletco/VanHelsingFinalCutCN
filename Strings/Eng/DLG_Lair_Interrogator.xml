					<eng>A dark dungeon with a grim interrogator! It brings back such sweet memories. Let’s do this!</eng>
				</Desc>

			<node10>
				<Desc>
					<eng>Excruciating Caress… It sounds effective. Do it.</eng>
				</Desc>

				<Desc>
					<eng>Khhm. “Since you stoooole my heeeeart… my life is nothing but… everlasting suuuffffeeee-ring…”</eng>
				</Desc>
			</node11>
			<node12>
				<Desc>
					<eng>So… A poem.  “How I loathe thee/With a passion simply too deep/ While the dawn is gently kissing the mountain / My bleeding heart can’t sustain/This suffocating pain!”</eng>
				</Desc>

			<node13>
				<Desc>
					<eng>Look, it’s a blackboard. Now I’m going to gently caress it… wait for it… scratching it with my… NAILS!</eng>
				</Desc>

			<node14>
				<Desc>
					<eng>Aaargh! NO! Stop it! I’ll talk!! The Cult of Seven has a hideout in the Thunderhead Mountains! In the Haunted Forest! I was sent here to rob laboratories, I don’t know anything else!</eng>
				</Desc>

			<node15>
				<Desc>
					<eng>This is TERRIBLE! Stop it! Stop! The Cult of Seven has a hideout in the Thunderhead Mountains, in the woods formerly known as the Haunted Forest! I was sent here to rob laboratories, I don’t know anything else!</eng>
				</Desc>
			</node15>
			<node16>
				<Desc>
					<eng>Aaargh….! YOU MONSTER! I'll talk! The Cult of Seven has a hideout in the Thunderhead Mountains, in the woods formerly known as the Haunted Forest! I was sent here to rob laboratories, I don’t know anything else!</eng>

				<Desc>
					<eng>Patience, Katarina. We should give our prisoner the opportunity to talk before we start torturing him.</eng>
				</Desc>
			</node2>
			<node3>
				<Desc>
					<eng>I will never talk, Van Helsing! The Faceless Tsar will be triumphant!</eng>
				</Desc>
			</node3>
			<node4>
				<Desc>
					<eng>Thought so. Look, I don’t want to resort to unnecessary brutality, but I’ll do anything to stop your cult and find your faceless leader. Jailor, do your best.</eng>
				</Desc>
			</node4>
			<node5>
				<Desc>
					<eng>Umm, yes. Right away… you might want to step out for a bit.</eng>
				</Desc>
			</node5>
			<node6>
				<Desc>
					<eng>Absolutely not! Do you have any idea when I last witnessed something like this?</eng>
				</Desc>
			</node6>
			<node7>
				<Desc>
					<eng>But we have never had any prisoners, so this is the first time for me… Can you help me to choose the perfect method? I could try Everlasting Suffering. Or should I resort to the Suffocating Pain? Or, if you dare to watch, I can use  the Excruciating Caress.</eng>
				</Desc>
			</node7>
			<node8>
				<Desc>
					<eng>Everlasting Suffering. Sounds… uncomfortable. Try it.</eng>
				</Desc>
			</node8>
			<node9>
				<Desc>
					<eng>Suffocating Pain sounds like something the old Borgovian vampire princes would have used. Try that.</eng>
