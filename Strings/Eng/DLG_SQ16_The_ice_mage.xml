					<eng>Van Helsing! Finally!</eng>

					<eng>Sorry... have we met?</eng>
				</Desc>
			</node2>
			<node3>
				<Desc>
					<eng>No. But I was expecting you. I need your help. In my arrogance I opened up the Gate of Perun… and I couldn’t bind the frost spirits that came pouring out. They are swarming everywhere.</eng>

				<Desc>
					<eng>Please tell me you had an emergency plan.</eng>

				<Desc>
					<eng>I have a very powerful moonstone... take it to the gate, touch it to the stone... it will close the doorway. But the spirits are everywhere... they will kill you!</eng>

				<Desc>
					<eng>Hm. It’s never easy, isn’t  it?</eng>

				<Desc>
					<eng>Do I really have to be voice of reason? It's so boring. But a magical gate that opens into the winter itself must be one those powerful seals. If we close it, we break it.</eng>

			<node8>
				<Desc>
					<eng>We can't have monsters swarming  all over the place. We deal with the frost spirits first, then see what we can do about the gate.</eng>
				</Desc>
			</node8>
			<node9>
				<Desc>
					<eng>You are right. It's painful to admit but we should leave that gate alone.</eng>
