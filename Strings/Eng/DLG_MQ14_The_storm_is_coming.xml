				<Desc>
					<eng>Van Helsing! Your ally is most upset. You should've set Perun free, not barter with those traitorous wardens.</eng>

			<node10>
				<Desc>
					<eng>A secret laboratory in the Ink? That sounds promising.</eng>
				</Desc>
			</node10>
			<node2>
				<Desc>
					<eng>If I remember your words correctly, the goal was not to set Perun free but to destroy the Force Domes. And I never saw a storm like this. It's making me nervous, but it will do the trick.</eng>

				<Desc>
					<eng>They will, when the raging storm engulfs the forsaken city! The winds are howling and lightning rips bleeding wounds in the sky! Your friend warns you to stay indoors for a while.</eng>

				<Desc>
					<eng>Really? Back to the damp cellars again?</eng>

				<Desc>
					<eng>There might be a task for you underground. While you were gone, I spent my time hunting for Fulmigati's secret laboratories. And I found the gate leading to one of the sealed territories in the Ink. The fabled Crystal Workshop, where the professor experimented with something uncannyâ€¦ Your weak friend here didn't dare to enter, but you should.</eng>

				<Desc>
					<eng>Oh, yes. What could go wrong, I wonder?</eng>
				</Desc>
			</node6>
			<node7>
				<Desc>
					<eng>This humble prisoner is most satisfied with you, hunter. Perun's rage has been unleashed!</eng>
				</Desc>
			</node7>
			<node8>
				<Desc>
					<eng>Yes, and I'm having serious doubts about the whole enterprise. But it's too late for that now, so we should focus on the Force Domes. Are they falling?</eng>
				</Desc>
			</node8>
			<node9>
				<Desc>
					<eng>It will do, but you could have done so much more damage. Still, it doesn't matter anymore. You should stay indoors for a while.</eng>
