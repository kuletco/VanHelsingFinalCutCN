00:00:06,626 --> 00:00:11,947
The civil war is barely over and now we must face a new problem.

2
00:00:12,615 --> 00:00:15,476
Something is happening beyond the veil of the world.

3
00:00:16,006 --> 00:00:19,585
A strange Inkgate has opened in our underground maze.

00:00:19,966 --> 00:00:27,708
It’s disturbingly close to my secret lair, and we don’t know
where it leads or what might come through that rift.

00:00:28,671 --> 00:00:32,679
I’ll do what any self-respecting hunter would do in my place.

00:00:33,381 --> 00:00:37,920
I enter the gate to find out how I could close it down.
