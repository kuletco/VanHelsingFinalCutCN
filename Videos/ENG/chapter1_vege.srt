1
00:00:03,517 --> 00:00:06,340
This is definitely a hunter’s dream come true

2
00:00:06,514 --> 00:00:09,786
sliding down from the mountains on a ropeway conveyor

3
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:12,410
 straight into the heart of darkness.

4
00:00:12,744 --> 00:00:15,766
At least this is what Borgova looks like from above

5
00:00:15,983 --> 00:00:18,935
a magnificent and twisted metropolis.

6
00:00:19,146 --> 00:00:22,722
It used to be a small, crooked town, as far as I know

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,114
but it is a sprawling, soot-stained monstrosity now.

8
00:00:27,157 --> 00:00:29,038
What happened to this city?

9
00:00:29,423 --> 00:00:32,374
First I locate my father’s hideout

10
00:00:32,433 --> 00:00:37,166
then I’ll find out what the mysterious Resistance can tell me.
