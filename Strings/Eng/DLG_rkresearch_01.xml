					<eng>Are you sure that the material can live up to this pompous name?</eng>

				<Desc>
					<eng>Undeniably, sir. It’s the personal research journal of none other than Professor Fulmigati. The first few glimpses were enough to ascertain that this material could change the way we look at Weird Science.</eng>

				<Desc>
