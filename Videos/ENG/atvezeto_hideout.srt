1
00:00:02,766 --> 00:00:06,605
Now I know what Prisoner Seven’s plan was all along.

2
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:10,894
He is rewriting the world with the artifact he stole.

3
00:00:11,181 --> 00:00:15,139
Changing it all back to the age before the Weird Science

4
00:00:15,674 --> 00:00:19,874
while turning the vampires into invincible monsters.

5
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:23,067
The Cult of Seven has been destroyed.

6
00:00:23,621 --> 00:00:28,266
I cut off the arms, now I must go for the head.

7
00:00:28,453 --> 00:00:30,128
Does my nemesis really think

8
00:00:30,128 --> 00:00:33,550
that he could derail me by threatening Borgova?

9
00:00:34,629 --> 00:00:37,155
He should know me better by now.
