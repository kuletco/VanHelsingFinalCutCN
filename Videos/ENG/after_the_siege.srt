1
00:00:01,978 --> 00:00:08,054
As famous last stands go, the battle for Viaduct Junction 
was quite spectacular.

2
00:00:09,021 --> 00:00:13,626
Sadly, it doesn’t change the fact that we are losing this war.

3
00:00:13,721 --> 00:00:17,277
I even had to leave behind important allies.

4
00:00:17,577 --> 00:00:19,815
General Harker is a worthy opponent.

5
00:00:19,982 --> 00:00:27,230
 He has salvaged the mad scientist’s toybox, found some real treasures 
and used them wisely.

6
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,163
Now the Force Domes are keeping us away 
from strategically important positions

7
00:00:33,345 --> 00:00:37,904
and the unnatural soldiers are forcing us back to the Lair.

8
00:00:38,339 --> 00:00:41,349
Harker is on his way to occupy the foundries.

9
00:00:41,393 --> 00:00:47,042
The mysterious Prisoner Seven promised to find a way 
to destroy the Domes.

10
00:00:47,615 --> 00:00:53,595
Until then, we must remain in the Lair that the General 
is so desperate to find

11
00:00:54,102 --> 00:00:58,915
So we will have to keep him busy.
