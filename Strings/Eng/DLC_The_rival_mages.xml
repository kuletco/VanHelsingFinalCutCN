					<eng>At least you could hear me out. I was exiled from my order and I had to leave our secret hideout. I won’t tolerate that kind of attitude, and frankly I need the place for myself. I thought that you might help me to get rid of my rivals. I’ll pay you 5000 Gold and some rare artifacts.</eng>
