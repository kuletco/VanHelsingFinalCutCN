1
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,491
The deeper I delve into the past of Borgovia

2
00:00:06,924 --> 00:00:09,807
 the more foulness comes to light.

3
00:00:09,975 --> 00:00:12,362
The vampire princes were just puppets

4
00:00:12,362 --> 00:00:15,671
of the faceless king ruling from the shadows.

5
00:00:16,076 --> 00:00:19,820
I destroyed his minions and averted the worst

6
00:00:20,343 --> 00:00:23,352
but the Ink is still gushing through the fresh cracks

7
00:00:23,658 --> 00:00:26,923
slowly dissolving the city of mad science

8
00:00:27,266 --> 00:00:31,478
changing it back into the dark world it used to be.

9
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:36,007
History wants to repeat itself, it seems.
